## About Me

I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications from Rabindranath Tagore University. With almost 2 years of experience as a Technical Support Executive and Customer Service Representative, I have developed strong skills in troubleshooting software and hardware issues, providing exceptional customer support, and resolving complex technical problems.

During my professional journey, I have honed my abilities in identifying and investigating user problems, fielding support inquiries through various channels (calls, chats, emails), guiding users through diagnostic processes, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to research and resolve intricate technical challenges.

In addition to my technical expertise, I possess a keen problem-solving aptitude, a professional demeanor, and a commitment to delivering outstanding customer service. I am proficient in using various tools and technologies, including Microsoft Windows and Office, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, and online chat and email support platforms.

Outside of work, I have a passion for reading and listening to books, playing chess and cricket, and exploring the world of music through the harmonica. These diverse interests not only provide me with a creative outlet but also contribute to my well-rounded personal growth and development.
